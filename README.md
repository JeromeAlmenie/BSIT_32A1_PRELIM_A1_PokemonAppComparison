My comparison to the given code is that the test.html only contains the main structure of the website, and the test.html is connected to the script.js
and the script.js is the code that gives instruction on what to do and the script.js is link in to many documents.
the style.css only contains the design like
- body, h1, form, input, button, button:hover, and #pokemon-details.
